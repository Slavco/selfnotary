selfnotary
==========

Notary process guide based on any bitcoin based blockchain without any third party involvement. This tool will generate  address from any document and creating transaction with minimum amount using your own wallet will be enough to prove that you are the document owner from transaction time until now.

All you need to have is document ( to find transaction via address  ) and wallet backup ( to be able to sign message ).
